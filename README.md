# FetchGitHubRepositories
Design a website that displays the public Github repositories belonging to any specific user.
I recommend to use "johnpapa" as the github user name for better understanding the functionalities.

## Note: 
In somecases you wont see the description and topics after fetching the repo's of a particular user,
because of the user haven't provided topics and description for the particular repository.
